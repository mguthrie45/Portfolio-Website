						<span>Stock Sentiment Analyzer</span>
					</div>
					<div class="project_descr">
						<p>A full-stack application made with Tkinter, BeautifulSoup4, and Vader's sentiment analysis tool to scrape web articles relating to specific stocks. Threading was used to conduct sentiment analysis on a time interval basis while the application is running. When the user's watchlist contains a stock that has changed sentiment significantly, the user is notified through the app and by email.</p>

						<span>Sorting Algorithm Visualizer Tool</span>
					</div>
					<div class="project_descr">
						<p>Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I made a responsive and minimalistic visualizer for the most famous sorting algorithms. Although JavaScript shows minimal support for OOP, this program heavily relied on the use of objects and classes.</p>
						<p>Aside from learning about sorting algorithms and recursion, this project taught me the basics of JavaScript canvas animations and the use of animation arrays.</p>

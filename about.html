					<p>I was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, and went to school in Mt. Lebanon. Since a young age, I have always loved using the analytical part of my mind to solve problems.</p>
					<p>During my childhood, I began my programming journey as a hobby by researching different languages and writing programs and scripts. As I learned more, I began to understand the true potential that digital technology has for making daily life more convenient and connecting people across the world. The hobby that I once started, making calculators and rock paper scissors, gradually became a passion. Now, it is my life's goal to join the programming community and to make a difference for those who rely on computers and applications.</p>
					<p>Software development is my passion, but I mainly enjoy physical and outside activities for my hobbies. Hiking and fishing are my favorite summertime activities, and I enjoy snowboarding in the winter. Anticipating that my career is performed mostly indoors, I find that balancing my work with outside activities is helpful towards my productivity and overall enjoyment.</p>

						<span>CMPEN270: Intro to Digital Design & Theory</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 2</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPEN270 focused on the basics of digital design, exploring combinational logic, sequential logic, logic gates, encoders/decoders, CMOS, latches, flip flops, state machines, and SRAM cells.</p>
						<p>Labs heavily relied on knowledge of logic gates and the ability to implement them on breadboards. The course also taught Verilog, which was a requirement for completing labs.</p>
						<p>A noteable project for CMPEN270 was a 7-segment LED counter with Verilog.</p>

						<span>CMPSC221: Object-Oriented Programming on the Web</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPSC221 taught the basics of GUI programming with an object-oriented approach. The class also covered the material involving relational databases. The languages mainly focused on in the course was Java, but learning SQL was another requirement.</p>
						<p>Noteworthy projects include a drawing application made with JFrames and a room reservation software using Java and Apache Derby.</p>

						<span>CMPSC360: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPSC360 logic, inference rules, and proof techniques were major areas of study. The course moved to probability, number theory, and graph theory.</p>

						<span>CMPEN331: Computer Organization & Design</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPEN331 covered computer architecture. The course revolved around MIPS instruction set architecture and the MIPS Assembly language.</p>
						<p>The course first studied assembly language and instruction formatting, MIPS pipeline stages, components of the CPU, hazards, and branch prediction.</p>
						<p>The second significant portion of the course involved the study of memory hierarchy, mainly focusing on cache memory, virtual memory and their performance measures.</p>
						<p>The final project was to simulate an entire 5-stage MIPS pipelined CPU with forwarding using Verilog.</p>

						<span>CMPSC465: Data Structures & Algoriths</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 4</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>Divide-and-conquer algorithms, graph algorithms, and greedy algorithms were major areas of study.</p>
						<p>The use of correctness proofs and space/time complexity analysis when studying algorithms was strongly emphasized.</p>

						<span>CMPSC311: Systems Programming</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 4</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>Technologies explored include the C programming language (useful functions/system calls, data types, libraries), UNIX OS, and Git.</p>
						<p>An understanding of UNIX and its tools/environment was necessary (Ubuntu VM used for all coursework).</p>
						<p>Explored shell programs, gcc compiler, makefiles, build sequences, memory management, caching, file systems, signal processing, socket programming, and parallel programming.</p>
						<p>The final project was a JBOD driver interface, implementing command processing, read/write calls, and caching. Remote read/write calls for JBOD servers were also implemented using sockets.</p>

						<span>CMPSC461: Programming Language Concepts</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 4</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammar, scopes, parameter passing, functional programming, lambda calculus, types, OOP, and memory management.</p>
						<p>The final project was an interpreter for a made up functional programming language using Racket. Types, lists, variables, functions, let blocks, and if statements were implemented.</p>

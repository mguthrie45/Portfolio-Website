						<span>CMPEN270: Intro to Digital Design & Theory</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 2</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPEN270 focused on the basics of digital design, starting with combinational logic and moving onto sequential logic. logic gates, encoders/decoders, CMOS, latches, flip flops, state machines, and SRAM cells were all major areas of study in this course.</p>
						<p>Labs heavily relied on knowledge of logic gates and the ability to implement them on breadboards. The course also taught Verilog, which was a requirement for completing labs.</p>
						<p>A noteable project for CMPEN270 was a 7-segment LED counter with Verilog.</p>

						<span>CMPSC221: Object-Oriented Programming on the Web</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPSC221 taught the basics of GUI programming with an object-oriented approach. The class also covered the material involving relational databases. The languages mainly focused on in the course was Java, but learning SQL was another requirement when working with databases.</p>
						<p>Noteworthy projects include a drawing application made with JFrames and a room reservation software using Java, SQL, and Apache Derby.</p>

						<span>CMPSC360: Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPSC360 spent the first half of the semester discussing logic, inference rules, and proof techniques. The course then moved to probability, number theory, and graph theory.</p>

						<span>CMPEN331: Computer Organization & Design</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 3</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPEN331 covered a wide range of topics. The course started with an introduction to MIPS instruction set architecture and CPU performance measures. A thorough understanding of MIPS assembly and instruction formats was necessary.</p>
						<p>The course transitioned to MIPS pipeline stages, components of the CPU, and an in-depth look into data hazards, structural hazards, and control hazards, and branch prediction. The course touched on exceptions and interrupts.</p>
						<p>The final significant portion of the course involved the study of memory hierarchy, cache memory and its performance measures.</p>
						<p>Most of the lab assignments built on each other and went towards making an entire 5-stage MIPS pipelined CPU. The final project finished it off by implementing forwarding for data hazards.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 4</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>Topics covered were time/space complexity, recurrence relations, proof techniques for correctness, dynamic programming, linear programming, and NP completeness.</p>
						<p>Divide-and-conquer algorithms, graph algorithms, and greedy algorithms were major areas of study.</p>

						<span>CMPSC311: Systems Programming</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 4</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>Technologies explored include the C programming language (useful functions, data types, structs, unions, and pointers), UNIX OS, and Git.</p>
						<p>An understanding of UNIX and its tools/environment was necessary (Ubuntu VM used for all coursework).</p>
						<p>Explored shell programs, compilers, makefiles, build sequences, memory management, file systems, signal processing, and parallel programming.</p>

						<span>CMPSC132: Intro to Data Structures</span>
					</div>
					<div class="time_taken">
						<span>Semester 2</span>
					</div>
					<div class="course_descr">
						<p>CMPSC132 taught the basics of inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation with Python. It also introduced students to data structures, including linked lists, stacks, queues, heaps, hash tables, and graphs. CMPSC132 also gave its students experience in sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and big O notation.</p>
						<p>Homework assignments primarily focused on programming and using data structures with an OOP approach.</p>
						<p>Noteworthy projects include a calculator and equation parser using stacks and postfix notation. Programmed a simulation of cache memory using hash tables and chaining.</p>

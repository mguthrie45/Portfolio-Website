						<p>Engineering-Consulting Collaborative (E-CC) is a professional organization dedicated to providing an environment for engineering and business students to collaborate in solving problems and improving professional and critical thinking skills.</p>
						<p>E-CC's exec board contains eight departments, including the technology department. E-CC also co-hosts events with companies, such as PWC and Delloite, and hosts its own case competitions, which all of the exec members help develop.</p>
						<p>The technology department handles many tasks, such as improving the club's website and working with a team of E-CC associates. The team of tech associates works with the director, making improvements to E-CC from a technology standpoint, helping local startups, and developing resume building projects.</P>
						<p>During 2020, I lead a four-person team to develop a Flask web application and an SQLAlchemy database to handle case competition registration and random team assignments.</p>
